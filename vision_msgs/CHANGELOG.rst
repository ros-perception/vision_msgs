Changelog for package vision_msgs
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

3.0.2 (2022-03-20)
------------------
* Build BoundingBox3DArray
* Contributors: Adam Allevato

3.0.1 (2021-07-20)
------------------
* Patch for how C++14 is set for ROS2 (`#58 <https://github.com/ros-perception/vision_msgs/issues/58>`_)
* Contributors: Dustin Franklin

3.0.0 (2021-04-13)
------------------
* Add license snippet in CONTRIBUTING.md
* Decouple source data from the detection/classification messages. (`#53 <https://github.com/ros-perception/vision_msgs/issues/53>`_)
  * Decouple source data from the detection/classification messages.
  This commit drops dependency on sensor_msgs
  * Improved documentation.
* Merge pull request `#52 <https://github.com/ros-perception/vision_msgs/issues/52>`_ from mintar/clarify-class-object-id
  Rename tracking_id -> id, id -> class_id
* Rename DetectionXD.tracking_id -> id
* Rename ObjectHypothesis.id -> class_id
* Merge pull request `#51 <https://github.com/ros-perception/vision_msgs/issues/51>`_ from ros-perception/clarify-bbox-size
  Clarify comment for size fields in bounding box messages
* Revert confusing comment about bbox orientation
* Merge pull request `#50 <https://github.com/ros-perception/vision_msgs/issues/50>`_ from ros-perception/remove-is-tracking-field
  Remove is_tracking field
* Remove other mentions to is_tracking field
* Clarify bbox size comment
* Remove tracking_id from Detection3D as well
* Remove is_tracking field
  This field does not seem useful, and we are not aware of anyone using it at this time. `VisionInfo` is probably a better place for this information anyway, if it were needed.
  See `#47 <https://github.com/ros-perception/vision_msgs/issues/47>`_ for earlier discussions.
* Clarify: ObjectHypothesis[] ~= Classification (`#49 <https://github.com/ros-perception/vision_msgs/issues/49>`_)
  * Clarify: ObjectHypothesis[] ~= Classification
  https://github.com/ros-perception/vision_msgs/issues/46 requested Array message types for ObjectHypothesis and/or ObjectHypothesisWithPose. As pointed out in the issue, these already exist in the form of the `ClassificationXD` and `DetectionXD` message types.
  * Clarify ObjectHypothesisWithPose[] ~= Detection
* Use composition in ObjectHypothesisWithPose (`#48 <https://github.com/ros-perception/vision_msgs/issues/48>`_)
* Contributors: Adam Allevato, Martin G端nther, Martin Pecka, root
